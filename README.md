# GoldMod-Cube2
Sauerbraten Server Modification ( based on remod )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Information:**

GoldMod is an advanced Server Fork for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, it includes many features to manage and host a good server. It's primary based on remod, but it's little modified in C++ and very much modified in CubeScript. Core is almost same as remod. Latest Release ( v4.7.5 ) got about 80 Commands and 36 IRC-Commands for IRC-Bot, a Cheater Detection, a script, that mutes Insulters and kicks players using offensive name. Much features are pushed from BuddyMod/remod -> repository is removed, but i will send optional packages, if somebody ask me per E-Mail. EDIT: Some modules are pushed from remod-userscripts, but no commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command Reference:

    #tm - That command starts tournament module ( written by me, from BuddyMod )
    #giveadmin - That command gives somebody on server admin privileges
    #priv - That command checks player privilege of all players and returns it in an info string
    #irc - This command says something directly into IRC-Channel ( only, if IRC-Bot is set )
    #say - That command says a public message to Server ( visible for everybody )
    #cheater - This command sends a cheater message to IRC and log ( admins check this then )
    #mspec - This command mutes all spectators on server ( #unmspec to unmute them )
    #ping - This command checks ping of all players and returns it in an info string

    enable-disable-commands-system

    GeoIP Continent ( written in CubeScript )
