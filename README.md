# GoldMod-Cube2
Sauerbraten Server Modification


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Information:**

GoldMod is a server modification based on degrave's remod. It contains more commands, more functions, better interface, better english, much more geoip functions and better IRC. It's got better administration
system and more settings variables to setup server as you wish. Latest version (5.0.0 - will release at 20.08.2016) got better interface, about 70+ commands and more messages for server. To edit source code 
just run stc/GoldMod.cbp . To compile it for windows you need to cross-compile with src/Makefile.win32 . For editing scripts ( cubescript ) used by server just connect to scripts/ directory and edit the contained .cfg files.
Good luck and have fun ;)

**Command Reference:**

    #tm - That command starts tournament module ( written by me, from BuddyMod )
    #setpriv - That command sets privilege of any player on server and can relinquish caller's one
    #priv - That command checks player privilege of all players and returns it in an info string
    #say - That command says a public message to Server ( visible for everybody )
    #cheater - This command sends a cheater message to IRC and log ( admins check this then )
    #mspec - This command mutes all spectators on server ( #unmspec to unmute them )
    #ping - This command checks ping of all players and returns it in an info string
    #eval - This command allows you to execute cubescript code directly on server
    #info - This command shows server information ( system, version, uptime, developer, ... )
    
    ... and much more ... :D

**Installation:**

For Windows: *** Installation for Windows is quite easy ***

      1.    Download Mod ( it would be an .zip package - you need 7zip or winrar to decompress it or just use windows-owned archive manager )
      2.    Open "server-init.cfg" and setup all required lines like your wishes
      3.    Close and save "server-init.cfg" file
      4.    Then start "GoldMod.exe" or "GoldMod.bat" 
      4.1   Just look at the taskbar near by the digital clock down right corner, there's an sauerbraten-similar icon, right click to it, click to "Open Console" to show server console or "Exit" for shutdown server
      4.1.1 If you use GoldMod.bat you need to close opened console and server console too, otherwise it will keep running
      5.    Server is running now. Connect to "log/" directory to show server log ( serverlog.gmsl )
      6.    Congratulations! You successfully set up your own server. ;D Have fun

      PS: To edit CubeScript Part of mod to to "scripts/" directory
      PPS: To edit source code, open "GoldMod.cbp" ( you need Code::Blocks )
      PPPS: Thanks to degrave for helping me with source ;)
      PPPPS: For linux and mac installation just follow remod instuctions, they are same
